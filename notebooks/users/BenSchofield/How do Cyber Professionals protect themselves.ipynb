How can we share basic good cyber hygiene good practice to help those outside the cyber community\n"

    "2. Map privacy threats to DFD elements\n",
    "The second step of the methodology uses the LINDDUN mapping template as shown in the table below (and in step 2 of the step-by-step example) as a guide to determine the threats that correspond to the DFD created in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyst should create a \"personalized\" table, based on LINDDUN's mapping table, which contains a row for each of the individual elements of the created DFD. This table can then be used as checklist throughout the elicitation phase, as each \"x\" in the table highlights a potential threat to the system that requires further analysis.\n",

    "Eliciting threats using threat tree patterns\n",
    "Each of the X's in the mapping table of step 2 are examined to determine whether they pose a threat to the system. To this aim, LINDDUN provides a set of privacy threat tree patterns. These trees represent the most common attack paths for a specific LINDDUN threat category and DFD element type. An example tree is shown below.\n",

    "Documenting threats using threat description template\n",
    "The analyst should examine each of the branches of the tree with the specifid DFD element in mind. Each of the leaf nodes (or branches) that are applicable should be documented as threat description (LINDDUN suggest misuse cases as appropriate description template).\n",
    "\n",
    "Documenting assumptions\n",
    "Leaf nodes and branches that are not applicable should be explicitly documented as assumptions. When one of the assumptions is altered in the process, it is important to easily track the required changes in the privacy analysis results.\n",

    "Furthermore, all the potential privacy threats that are suggested by the privacy threat trees are evaluated and prioritized via risk assessment (step 4). Note that LINDDUN does not provide explicit risk analysis support. We merely refer the analyst to established risk assessment techniques.\n",
