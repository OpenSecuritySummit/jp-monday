    "1. Set up a recovery phone number or email address, and keep it updated.\n",
    "The majority of people surveyed said they have either a secondary email address (87 percent) or mobile device (73 percent) set for account recovery and security purposes—and that’s great.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For many web services, your Google Account included, having a recovery method can help alert you if there’s suspicious activity on your account or if you need to block someone from using your account without permission. And of course, adding recovery information to your account can help you get back in more quickly if you ever lose access or can't sign in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up recovery information, visit your Google Account’s Security section and scroll down to “Ways we can verify it's you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use unique passwords for your accounts.\n",
    "65 percent of respondents in our poll said they reuse the same password for multiple accounts, which can increase your security risk. It’s like using the same key to lock your home, car and office—if someone gains access to one, all of them could be compromised.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a unique password for each account to eliminate this risk. Make sure that each password is hard to guess and better yet, at least eight characters long. It can be hard to keep track of many different passwords—60 percent of people report having too many passwords to remember. To help, consider using a password manager (like the one built into your Chrome browser) to help you create, safeguard and keep track of all your passwords. If that is too difficult, you can even write your passwords down on a piece of paper (but keep it in a safe place!), since hijackers are most likely to be online, rather than physically near you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep your software up to date.\n",
    "To help protect your online activity, make sure you’re always running the latest version of software on all your devices. The Harris Poll results show that, while 79 percent of respondents said they understood the importance of updating their software, one third of people said they still don’t regularly update their applications, or aren’t sure if they do or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re using the below operating systems, here’s where you can look to learn how to check & update the software on your devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows support\n",
    "Mac\n",
    "Android\n",
    "iOS\n",
    "Some software, like Chrome, will automatically update so you never need to worry about doing it yourself. For other services that send notifications when it’s time to update, don’t click “remind me later”— take the time to install the update right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Go a step further by setting up two-factor authentication.\n",
    "Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA)—also known as 2-Step Verification—significantly decreases the chance of someone gaining unauthorized access to your account. For the majority of people, Google’s automatic and risk-based sign-in protections are more than enough, but everyone should know that 2FA is an extra option. However, one in three survey respondents (31 percent) said they do not use 2FA, or don’t know if they are using it or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2FA requires you to take a second step each time you sign in to your account on top of your username and password. Examples of second verification steps include: an SMS text message, a six-digit code generated by an app, a prompt that you receive on a trusted device or the use of a physical security key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up two-factor authentication for your Google Account by visiting g.co/2sv and clicking “Get Started.”\n",
