    "# Cyber Risk Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil brings his extensive experience to a discussion on modelling (general) risk and comparing security risk modelling maturity to other markets (finance, insurance, medical..). This also involves attribution of $ value to risk and how security teams can talk the language of the business\n",
    "\n",
    "## What\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Security Risk Management is Broken\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of complexity and uncertainty in cyber risk.\n",
    "Current practice tends to hide uncertainty and present certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Ordinal Scales (Red, Amber, Green / High, Medium, Low / 1,2,3,4,5 etc) rather than Cardinal measures (£ or %).\n",
    "Is a red x red risk a really red risk? Twice as bad? Three times as bad?\n",
    "We then assign numerical values to support ‘risk arithmetic’ (5 x 5 = 25 /2.5 = risk score)\n",
    "OWASP Risk Rating Methodology (Risk Factors / Ordinal Scales)\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use risk matrices that arbitrarily identify an ordinal boundary as the ‘risk appetite’. (Amber =Good, red = Bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning a single value to probability and impact we are communicating a level of certainty about the outcome we don’t really have.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are individually poor at prediction\n",
    "Hedgehogs / Foxes / Superpredictors\n",
    "\n",
    "We are awash with data about cyber events but few documented robust statistical methods deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions are well known by other risk professions\n",
    "\n",
    "Appetite and tolerance\n",
    "\n",
